/**
 * This is a CRTP based Trait implementation that allows to use Trait like
 * classes to create polymorphic functions and API statically at compile type
 * without any runtime shenanigans. For more on CRTP checkout:
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern
 *
 * In order to define a trait, use the `TraitBase` class like:

 * \code
 * template <typename ConcreteType>
 * class Blahable : public TraitBase<ConcreteType, Blahable> {}
 * \endcode
 *
 * Every Trait has to take the `ConcreteType` as template argument and pass it
 * to the `TraitBase`. Checkout the documentation of `TraitBase` for more info
 * on creating a new Trait.
 *
 * Alongside with each Trait type, you should provide the "Official" interface
 * of the Trait via some standalone functions that operates on the Trait type.
 * For example Imagine we have a Trait type called `ABC` with two main
 * functionality `foo` and `bar`. We need to create two functions as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * template <typename T>
 * SomeType Foo(ABC<T> &t) { return t.foo(); };
 *
 * template <typename T>
 * SomeType bar(ABC<T> &t, int x) { return t.bar(x); };
 * \endcode
 *
 * These two functions will be the official interface to the trait `ABC`.
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to pass a reference of type `ABC<T>` to the
 * functions and DO NOT PASS BY COPY. Since copying will copy the value by the
 * trait type only, we would not be able to statically case it to the
 * implementor type and it will lead to some allocation problem.
 *
 * Traits can be used via `WithTrait` helper class which provides a clean
 * interface to mix and match Trait types.
 *
