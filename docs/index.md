# “What I cannot create, I do not understand”
-- Richard Feynman

## Serene is ...
A modern lisp, and it is to be born. It started out of the curiosity of the author and his journey
through computer science and mathematics. We are at the early stages of the development process
and there is a long way to go. If you're interested, contact us by joining our mailing list and
checkout the git repository. Furthermore, we document our progress in development via some video
tutorials and code walkthrough that can be a good guide for the developers who are eager to join
the team. You can find the videos on [my :fontawesome-brands-youtube:{ .youtube } YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/lxsameer).


## Announcements:

### * How to build a compiler with LLVM and MLIR
I have decided to make a video series as a guide and walk through the Serene’s code base. This
way, anyone who is interested in Serene but never done language development will have an easier
time getting started with Serene. It will also serve as a historical documentary for some
decisions and implementations that we made throughout the development process. The video series
in accessible via my YouTube channel and How to build a compiler with LLVM and MLIR playlist.
Looking forward to your feedback. :smile:
