* Serene lang
** Setup development environment
*** Emacs
Install the dependencies including ~clangd~ and just run ~lsp~

**** Requirements on the Rust side
To setup the dev envrionment you need to have *Clippy* and *RLS* installed. Run the
following commands to install them:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rustup component add rls --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup component add --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu clippy
rustup component add rustfmt
#+END_SRC

Use your desired toolchain instead of *stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu*
