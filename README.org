* Serene lang
** Setup development environment
*** Emacs
[[https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic][Rustic]] is highly recommended. Just install it and install the dependencies necessary
on the Rust side. If you're using *FG42*, It already ships with Rustic installed.

**** Requirements on the Rust side
To setup the dev envrionment you need to have *Clippy* and *RLS* installed. Run the
following commands to install them:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rustup component add rls --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup component add --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu clippy
#+END_SRC

Use your desired toolchain instead of *stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu*
